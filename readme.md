# Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run **AutoSolve AI** on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python** (3.7 or later)
- **Node.js** (14.x or later)
- **pip** (Python package installer)

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Install Training Code:
  ```bash
    python train_model.py
  ```
 Train and save the problem classifier model: Ensure you have trained your model and saved it as `problem_classifier.joblib` in the backend directory. *(Training code not provided in this repository)

4. Run the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
   The backend server will start at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure the proxy in `package.json`: In your `frontend/package.json` file, add the following line to ensure API calls are proxied to the backend:
    ```json
    "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
    ```

4. Run the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   The frontend will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

   - **Access the Frontend**: Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

1. Build the frontend for production:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
   This creates an optimized build in the `frontend/build` directory.

2. Serve the build files: Use a static file server or integrate with your backend server to serve the built files.

### Backend Deployment

1. Deploy the FastAPI backend: Use services like **Heroku**, **AWS**, or **DigitalOcean** to deploy your backend.

2. Configure environment variables: Ensure any necessary environment variables (e.g., database connections) are set in your deployment environment.

## Additional Features

To make the AutoSolve AI tool even more powerful, consider implementing the following features:

- Integration with external data sources (APIs, databases)
- Advanced data visualization options (3D plots, interactive graphs)
- Cloud deployment options (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Natural language query interface for data analysis
- Automated report generation for solved problems
